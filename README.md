# Translation-Using-Sequence-to-Sequence-Modelling

Implement an encoder-decoder network using RNNs to utilize attention, and learn a conditional language model for the task of translating the names to Hindi.
• Used merge rules (BPE, WordPiece, etc.) for Hindi accents to automatically learn a suitable sub-word tokenization strategy from the given data
• Worked with decoding strategies to produce better approximations like Beam-Search Decoding and Viterbi Decoding.
